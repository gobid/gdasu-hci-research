Gobi Dasu's HCI Research interests, ideations, projects, and writings

My current interests (subject to evolve) are at the intersection of CS Education (with an ICT4D twist), the Future of Work, and Programming Tools.

Ideally, projects I'm involved in will:
- train engineers and match them with work opportunities
- explore extrinsic and intrinsic motivation for skill development
- engage social and technical checks and balances that focus on work quality
- be self-sufficient, economically viable solutions to global inequality (complex well-paying work, not microtasks)
