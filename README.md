Gobi Dasu's HCI Research interests, ideations, projects, and writings

My current interests (subject to evolve) are at the intersection of collaboration, ICT4D, educational conditional cash transfer, and the future of work.

Ideally, projects I'm involved in will:
- create productive and collaborative communities out of strangers on the internet
- explore extrinsic and intrinsic motivation for skill development
- engage checks and balances centered around work quality
- be economically self-sufficient and hence viable solutions for global wealth and knowledge inequality
