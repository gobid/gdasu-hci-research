Gobi Dasu's HCI Research interests, ideations, projects, and writings

My current interests (subject to evolve) are at the intersection of collaboration, ICT4D, educational conditional cash transfer, and the future of work.

Ideally, projects I'm involved in will:
- create productive and collaborative communities out of strangers on the internet
- explore extrinsic and intrinsic motivation for skill development
- engage social and technical checks and balances that focus on work quality
- be self-sufficient, economically viable solutions to global wealth and education inequality
