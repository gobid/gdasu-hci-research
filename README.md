Gobi Dasu's HCI Research interests, ideations, projects, and writings

My current interests (subject to evolve) are at the intersection of collaboration, ICT4D, educational conditional cash transfer, and the future of work.

Ideally, projects I'm involved in will:
- create productive and collaborative communities out of strangers on the internet
- explore extrinsic and intrinsic motivation for skill development
- engage social and technical checks and balances that focus on work quality
- be self-sufficient, economically viable solutions to global inequality (complex well-paying work, not microtasks)

Brainstorms:

[Inspired by ARS] ARS levarages senior students as a communication link between professor and undergrad and functions as a time saver. Clients in OECD countries and talented engineers around the world need a *communication liason*. Who is this liason -- a patient and non-technical UI stickler in the country of the client?

[Related to Understanding Trust amid Delays in Crowdfunding] This paper uncovers insights about the importance of creator transparency in keeping backer trust. In a future-of-work setting, responsiveness of the engineer and even transparency of their condition may play a similar role in keeping the trust of their manager or client. How can collaborative systems (like slack) identify and reward responsiveness? How can the systems support transparency of the worker condition so that project managers and clients can know who to hire, how to communicate, and what to plan for?

[Inspired by Cobi] Cobi tackles finite-length event planning subject to the constraint of attendee preferences. A natural extension in the crowd work setting is who should work on what when. A firm has projects, limited engineering talent, limited time, and a slough of human emotions and preferences. What's the best way to assign hour blocks of engineer time to different projects? A cobi-esque system (perhaps via slack) will now have to deal with the fact that projects are long-term and also can take longer than planned for, humans not only have different preferences but also different skills, and clients and managers have preferences and schedules and time zones as well.
