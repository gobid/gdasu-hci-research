Gobi Dasu's CS Education and HCI Research interests, ideations, projects, and writings

My current interests (subject to evolve) are at the intersection of CS Education (with an ICT4D twist), the Future of Work, and Programming Tools.

**Contributions:**
1. Blog Post on Industry Driven Educational Conditional Cash Transfer to Address World Poverty - https://blog.learningdollars.com/2019/11/17/how-to-end-world-poverty-and-racial-power-imbalance-in-1-generation/ (inspired the Financial Incentives project I did in my masters, pdf above)
2. Mentored Students who produced Knowledge Maps CHI SRC - https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3334480.3381444
3. Blog Posts on Engineering Management - https://blog.learningdollars.com/2020/03/31/developer-time-tracking-using-slack-beyond-fixed-price-vs-hourly/ (inspired the AST project I did in my masters, pdf above)

**Interests:** Ideally, projects I'm involved in will:
- train engineers and match them with work opportunities
- explore extrinsic and intrinsic motivation for skill development
- engage social and technical checks and balances that focus on work quality
- be self-sufficient, economically viable solutions to global inequality (complex well-paying work, not microtasks)

**Advisors:** I have been advised by Haoqi Zhang and Nell O'Rourke in my PhD at Northwestern, and Michael Bernstein in my masters at Stanford.
